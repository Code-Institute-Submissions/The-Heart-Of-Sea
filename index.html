                            <p>Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer,
                                songwriter,
                                and record producer
                                who
                                co-founded the Heart Of Sea. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson
                                wrote
                                or co-wrote more than

                                composition and mastery of
                                recording techniques, Wilson is known for his lifelong struggles with mental
                                illness.
                                He is often referred

                                as a "genius" and is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and

                                    <p>Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician,
                                        singer, songwriter, and record producer
                                        who
                                        co-founded the Heart Of Sea. After signing with Capitol Records in
                                        1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than

                                        with mental illness. He is often referred to
                                        as a "genius" and is widely acknowledged as one of the most

                                        late 20th century.

                                    </p>

                                    <p> The Heart Of Sea were formed by Wilson with his brothers Carl and
                                        Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and
                                        friend Al
                                        Jardine. Brian, who grew up influenced by 1950s rock and roll and
                                        jazz-based vocal groups, originally
                                        functioned as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist,
                                        bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader.
                                        In
                                        1964, he suffered a nervous breakdown and stopped touring with the
                                        group, which led to more personal work
                                        such
                                        as Pet Sounds (1966) and the unfinished Smile. As his mental health
                                        deteriorated, his contributions to the
                                        band
                                        diminished, and over the next decade, he was reputed for his
                                        reclusive lifestyle and substance abuse.</p>

                                    <p>Following a 1992 court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist
                                        Eugene Landy, Wilson started receiving
                                        conventional medical treatment, and in the late 1990s, he began
                                        performing and recording consistently as a
                                        solo
                                        artist. He remains a member of the Heart Of Sea' corporation,
                                        Brother Records Inc.</p>

                                    <p>Wilson was the first pop artist credited for writing, arranging,
                                        producing, and performing his own material.
                                        He
                                        is considered a major innovator in the field of music production,
                                        the principal originator of the California
                                        Sound, one of the first music producer auteurs, and the first rock
                                        producer to use the studio as its own
                                        instrument. The unusual creative control Capitol gave him over his
                                        own records effectively set a precedent
                                        that
                                        allowed other bands and artists to act as their own producers or
                                        co-producers. Wilson's success also led to a
                                        proliferation of like-minded California producers who helped
                                        supplant New York as the center of popular
                                        records. The zeitgeist of the early 1960s is commonly associated to
                                        his early songs, and he was a major
                                        influence on the retrospectively-termed "sunshine pop" and Flower
                                        Power music that proceeded.</p>

                                    <p> In later years, Wilson became influential to the spirit of punk rock
                                        and was regarded as "godfather" to an
                                        era
                                        of indie musicians who were inspired by his melodic sensibilities,
                                        chamber pop orchestrations, and recording
                                        explorations. His honors include being inducted into the 1988 Rock
                                        and Roll Hall of Fame and winning Grammy
                                        Awards for Brian Wilson Presents Smile (2004) and The Smile Sessions
                                        (2011). In lists published by Rolling
                                        Stone, Wilson ranked 52 for the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time"
                                        in 2008 and 12 for the "100 Greatest
                                        Songwriters of All Time" in 2015. In 2012, music publication NME
                                        ranked Wilson number 8 in its "50 Greatest
                                        Producers Ever" list, elaborating "few consider quite how
                                        groundbreaking Brian Wilson's studio techniques
                                        were
                                        in the mid-60s".His life was dramatized in the 2014 biopic Love &
                                        Mercy.</p>

                                    <p>Grammy® Winner and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Member, Michael Edward
                                        Love (born March 15, 1941) is an
                                        American
                                        singer and songwriter who co-founded the Heart Of Sea. Characterized
                                        by his nasal and sometimes baritone
                                        singing, Love has been one of the band's vocalists and lyricists for
                                        their entire career, contributing to
                                        each
                                        of their studio albums and serving as their frontman for live
                                        performances. He is often regarded as a malign
                                        figure in the band's history, a reputation he acknowledges: "For
                                        those who believe that Brian [Wilson] walks
                                        on
                                        water, I will always be the Antichrist."</p>

                                    <p>Love was one of Wilson's collaborators during the Heart Of Sea' peak
                                        in the 1960s. Among the band's US Top
                                        10
                                        hits was the Wilson–Love songs "Fun, Fun, Fun" (1964), "California
                                        Girls" (1965), and "Good Vibrations"
                                        (1966).
                                        Love's lyrics primarily reflected the youth culture of surfing,
                                        cars, and romance, which helped fashion pop
                                        culture's perception of the "California Dream". Starting in 1968,
                                        Love was a student of Transcendental
                                        Meditation (TM) under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and became a TM teacher
                                        in 1971. The experience influenced his
                                        lyrics to take on themes of astrology, meditation, politics and
                                        ecology. In the late 1970s, Love began
                                        working
                                        on solo albums, releasing his first in 1981: Looking Back with Love.
                                        In 1988, Love was inducted into the Rock
                                        and Roll Hall of Fame, along with the other founding members of the
                                        Heart Of Sea. In the same year, the song,
                                        "Kokomo", co-written by Love, reached number one in the United
                                        States and was nominated for a Grammy.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Many of Love's contributions to the group's hits were not officially
                                        recognized until the 1990s, when he
                                        successfully sued for writing credits on 35 songs. He remains
                                        uncredited for another 44 Heart Of Sea songs he
                                        alleged to have co-written. In 1998, following the death of cousin
                                        Carl Wilson, Love was given an exclusive
                                        license to tour under the name the Heart Of Sea. His surviving
                                        bandmates, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine,
                                        embarked
                                        on solo endeavors. In 2011, the group reunited to produce a new
                                        album and embark on a tour for their 50th
                                        anniversary. Following the 50th anniversary reunion shows, Love
                                        resumed touring only with Bruce Johnston.</p>

                                    <p> he was reunited
                                        with Brian and first presented the idea of forming a band as the two
                                        worked through harmony ideas
                                        together
                                        in

                                        and he learned banjo and guitar
                                        specifically to play folk music. When the Heart Of Sea formed at
                                        Wilson's home, he first tried to push
                                        the
                                        band
                                        toward folk but was overruled in favor of rock 'n' roll. </p>

                                        An all-rounder on string instruments, Jardine played stand-up bass
                                        on the Heart Of Sea' first
                                        recording,

                                        "Surfin'" (1961). Following his brief departure from the band in
                                        early 1962, he dabbled with a
                                        career in
