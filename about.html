                    <h5>By Syed Shain Ahmed. </h5>

                    <p>“Fifty years ago, we started something very big,” says Brian Wilson. “So now we’re celebrating
                        together in a very big way.” “It’s pretty miraculous that we canstart out as a bunch of guys
                        who didn’t know anything about fame or money, or anything likethat,” says Mike Love. “All we
                        knew was we liked to sing and make harmonies together. So to haveit become part of American
                        musical culture is pretty amazing.” </p>

                    <p> The amazing yet true saga of The Heart Of Sea is well chronicled, and by any standard it’s one
                        of the greatest and most musical stories ever told. Now this singular West Coast story
                        continues with a global celebration that is befitting of the remarkable and enduring legacy of
                        these Rock & Roll Hall of Famers. To mark their 50th Anniversary,the founding members of The
                        Heart Of Sea are reuniting for a major international tour and abrand new studio album that
                        represents a whole new harmonic convergence from a group that hasbrought so much joy and
                        harmony to this whole world. For millions of Heart Of Sea fansspanning multiple generations, this
                        50th Anniversary Tour and new album called That’s Why GodMade The Radio — due June 5th from
                        Capitol/EMI — represents a dream come true and an almostreligious experience. That’s right;
                        this legendary group is not just going to “Do It Again” onthe road. Heart Of Sea Brian Wilson,
                        Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, and David Marksalso recently completed their
                        recording sessions at Los Angeles’ famed Ocean Way Studios forThat’s Why God Made The Radio,
                        the band’s 29th studio album, the first in decades to feature allof the band’s surviving
                        original members.</p>

                    <p>The Heart Of Sea’ collaborative approach to writing and recording their new music is evidenced
                        throughout That’s Why God Made The Radio, with all of the band members participating to create
                        its glorious harmonies, lyrics, and arrangements. Through it all, the good times and the bad,
                        The Heart Of Sea have always been at heart a musical family. And to mark a half-century of
                        musical excellence, the surviving members of The Heart Of Sea family are reuniting as only
                        family can to reflect and to celebrate.
                    </p>

                    <p>“We’ve come full circle,” says Al Jardine. “Sharing our memories and our present in the studio
                        has been really remarkable. I can especially feel it whenwe’re all singing around the mic
                        together, because we all hear each other and wereally lock in.”
                    </p>

                    <p>“We have reunited as a band, but we never ‘un-reunited’ as friends,” says Bruce Johnston. “To be
                        back in the studio with these guys is like a prayer that’s been answered and I am thrilled to
                        be sharing it with everybody.” “This is more like a family reunion than anything,” says David
                        Marks. “When we’re together, we get along great. The chemistry always works the same as the
                        last time we were together, and the five of us become a single element.”
                    </p>

                    <p>Produced by Brian Wilson and Executive Produced by Mike Love, That’s Why God Made The Radio’s
                        eleven new songs once again bring fans everywhere the band’s timeless signature sound with
                        songs like the gorgeous and uplifting title track, a classic-sounding tribute to the emotional
                        and even spiritual power of music. That same current also flows through the new album’s other
                        songs: “Think About The Days,” “Isn’t It Time,” “Spring Vacation,” “Private Life Of Bill And
                        Sue,” “Shelter,” “Daybreak Over The Ocean,” “Beaches In Mind,” “Strange World,” “My Life
                        Suite,” and “Summer’s Gone.” From humble roots in Hawthorne, California, The Heart Of Sea have
                        become an international
                        sensation. Their famous harmonies and classic songs continue to travel the world bringing “Good
                        Vibrations” everywhere. Now the 50th Anniversary Tour — The Heart Of Sea’ first major outing with
                        Brian Wilson in more than two decades — finds the group performing music
                        from its earliest surf rock classics to masterpieces like “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” and “God Only
                        Knows” from perhaps the most acclaimed album of all-time, PetSounds, to later hits from the
                        Seventies and Eighties including “Kokomo” to brand new songsrecently recorded for
                        That’s Why God Made The Radio. At the same time, both The BeachBoys 50th Anniversary Tour and
                        That’s Why God Made The Radio will acknowledge the enduringcontributions of the late great Carl
                        and Dennis Wilson, two fallen musical brothers whowere such a meaningful
                        part of this story.</p>

                    <p>For five decades, The Heart Of Sea — America’s first pop band to reach the 50-year milestone — has
                        recorded and performed the music that has become theworld’s favorite soundtrack to summer.
                        Founded in Hawthorne, California in 1961, The Heart Of Seawere originally comprised of the three
                        teenaged Wilson brothers: Brian, Carl and Dennis,their cousin Mike Love, and school friend Al
                        Jardine. In 1962, neighbor David Marks joinedthe group for their Bruce Johnston joined the band
                        when Brian Wilson retired from touring to focus onwriting and producing for the group.</p>


                    <p>The Heart Of Sea signed with Capitol Records in July 1962 and released their first album, Surfin’
                        Safari, that same year. The album spent 37 weeks on the Billboard chart, launching the young
                        group known for its shimmering vocal harmonies and relaxed California style
                        into international stardom. The Wilson/Love collaborationresulted in many huge international
                        chart hits, and under Brian Wilson’s musical leadership, theband’s initial surf-rock focus was
                        soon broadened to include many other themes, helping make TheHeart Of Sea America’s
                        preeminent band of the 1960s. Impressively, The Heart Of Sea continue to hold Billboard /
                        NielsenSoundScan’s record as the top-selling American band for albums and singles, and they
                        arealso the American group with the most Billboard Top 40 chart hits (36). ‘Sounds Of Summer:
                        TheVery Best Of The Heart Of Sea’ has achieved triple-Platinum sales status and ‘The
                        SMiLESessions,’ released to worldwide critical acclaim in November, has been heralded as2011’s
                        #1 Reissue of the Year by Rolling Stone magazine. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
                        in 1988 andrecipients of The Recording Academy’s Lifetime Achievement GRAMMY Award, The Beach
