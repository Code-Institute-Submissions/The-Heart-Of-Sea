                <h1>About Alan Charles </h1>
                <p>Alan Charles Jardine was born in Lima, Ohio, but his family moved to San Francisco and later to
                    Hawthorne,
                    California. At Hawthorne High School, he befriended fellow football player Brian Wilson and watched
                    Brian
                    and brother Carl Wilson singing at a school assembly. After attending Ferris State University
                    during the
                    1960-61 academic year, Jardine registered as a student at El Camino College in 1961.
                </p>

                There, he was reunited
                with Brian and first presented the idea of forming a band as the two worked through harmony ideas
                together
                in
                the college's music room. Jardine's primary musical interest was folk and he learned banjo and guitar
                specifically to play folk music. When the Heart Of Sea formed at Wilson's home, he first tried to push
                the
                band
                toward folk but was overruled in favor of rock 'n' roll. </p>
                <p>
                    An all-rounder on string instruments, Jardine played stand-up bass on the Heart Of Sea' first
                    recording,
                    the
                    song
                    "Surfin'" (1961). Following his brief departure from the band in early 1962, he dabbled with a
                    career in
                    the
                    aerospace industry in Los Angeles. Jardine fully rejoined the Heart Of Sea in the summer of 1963 at
                    Brian
                    Wilson's request and worked alongside guitarist David Marks with the band until October 1963, when
                    Marks
                    quit
                    the Heart Of Sea after an altercation with the band's manager, Murry Wilson.</p>
