        <h1 class="text-capitalize">About Mike Love </h1>
        <p>Grammy® Winner and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Member, Michael Edward Love, grew up under the Southern
          California.
          sun where he soaked up a life of music, surf, sand and sport. Beginning his singing career as a young boy,
          Mike
          along with his cousin, Brian Wilson, frequently sang at family get-togethers and holiday gatherings. These
          early
          influences served as the inspiration to form the legendary group, The Heart Of Sea, which originally
          consisted
          of
          Mike and his cousins, Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson along with neighbor David Marks and High School friend
          Alan
          Jardine. </p>

        <p>Grammy® Winner and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Member, Michael Edward Love (born March 15, 1941) is an
          American
          singer and songwriter who co-founded the Heart Of Sea. Characterized by his nasal and sometimes baritone
          singing, Love has been one of the band's vocalists and lyricists for their entire career, contributing to
          each
          of their studio albums and serving as their frontman for live performances. He is often regarded as a malign
          figure in the band's history, a reputation he acknowledges: "For those who believe that Brian [Wilson] walks
          on
          water, I will always be the Antichrist."</p>

        <p>Love was one of Wilson's collaborators during the Heart Of Sea' peak in the 1960s. Among the band's US Top
          10
          hits was the Wilson–Love songs "Fun, Fun, Fun" (1964), "California Girls" (1965), and "Good Vibrations"
          (1966).
          Love's lyrics primarily reflected the youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance, which helped fashion pop
          culture's perception of the "California Dream". Starting in 1968, Love was a student of Transcendental
          Meditation (TM) under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and became a TM teacher in 1971. The experience influenced his
          lyrics to take on themes of astrology, meditation, politics and ecology. In the late 1970s, Love began
          working
          on solo albums, releasing his first in 1981: Looking Back with Love. In 1988, Love was inducted into the Rock
          and Roll Hall of Fame, along with the other founding members of the Heart Of Sea. In the same year, the song,
          "Kokomo", co-written by Love, reached number one in the United States and was nominated for a Grammy.</p>

        <p>
          Many of Love's contributions to the group's hits were not officially recognized until the 1990s, when he
          successfully sued for writing credits on 35 songs. He remains uncredited for another 44 Heart Of Sea songs he
          alleged to have co-written. In 1998, following the death of cousin Carl Wilson, Love was given an exclusive
          license to tour under the name the Heart Of Sea. His surviving bandmates, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine,
          embarked
          on solo endeavors. In 2011, the group reunited to produce a new album and embark on a tour for their 50th
          anniversary. Following the 50th anniversary reunion shows, Love resumed touring only with Bruce Johnston.</p>
