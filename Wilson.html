        <h1>ABOUT Brian Wilson </h1>
        <p>Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer
          who
          co-founded the Heart Of Sea. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than
          two
          dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of
          recording techniques, Wilson is known for his lifelong struggles with mental illness. He is often referred to
          as a "genius" and is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the
          late 20th century.

        </p>

        <p> The Heart Of Sea were formed by Wilson with his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and
          friend Al
          Jardine. Brian, who grew up influenced by 1950s rock and roll and jazz-based vocal groups, originally
          functioned as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader.
          In
          1964, he suffered a nervous breakdown and stopped touring with the group, which led to more personal work
          such
          as Pet Sounds (1966) and the unfinished Smile. As his mental health deteriorated, his contributions to the
          band
          diminished, and over the next decade, he was reputed for his reclusive lifestyle and substance abuse.</p>

        <p>Following a 1992 court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist Eugene Landy, Wilson started receiving
          conventional medical treatment, and in the late 1990s, he began performing and recording consistently as a
          solo
          artist. He remains a member of the Heart Of Sea' corporation, Brother Records Inc.</p>

        <p>Wilson was the first pop artist credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material.
          He
          is considered a major innovator in the field of music production, the principal originator of the California
          Sound, one of the first music producer auteurs, and the first rock producer to use the studio as its own
          instrument. The unusual creative control Capitol gave him over his own records effectively set a precedent
          that
          allowed other bands and artists to act as their own producers or co-producers. Wilson's success also led to a
          proliferation of like-minded California producers who helped supplant New York as the center of popular
          records. The zeitgeist of the early 1960s is commonly associated to his early songs, and he was a major
          influence on the retrospectively-termed "sunshine pop" and Flower Power music that proceeded.</p>

        <p> In later years, Wilson became influential to the spirit of punk rock and was regarded as "godfather" to an
          era
          of indie musicians who were inspired by his melodic sensibilities, chamber pop orchestrations, and recording
          explorations. His honors include being inducted into the 1988 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and winning Grammy
          Awards for Brian Wilson Presents Smile (2004) and The Smile Sessions (2011). In lists published by Rolling
          Stone, Wilson ranked 52 for the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time" in 2008 and 12 for the "100 Greatest
          Songwriters of All Time" in 2015. In 2012, music publication NME ranked Wilson number 8 in its "50 Greatest
          Producers Ever" list, elaborating "few consider quite how groundbreaking Brian Wilson's studio techniques
          were
          in the mid-60s".His life was dramatized in the 2014 biopic Love & Mercy.</p>
